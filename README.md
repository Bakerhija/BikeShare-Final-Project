## Project Title: 

**Explore US Bikeshare Data**


## Project Description

This project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Degree program and involves the exploration of bike share data from three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I will analyze the data, compute descriptive statistics, and create an interactive terminal experience for users to access these statistics.


## Software and Tools

To complete this project, the following software and tools are required:

* Language ([Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python"))
* A text editor ([Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3 "Sublime"))
* A terminal application ([git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "git")).


## Datasets

The project utilizes datasets provided by Motivate, a U.S. bike share system provider. These datasets contain randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The core columns in all three datasets include:

- Start Time
- End Time
- Trip Duration
- Start Station
- End Station
- User Type

Additionally, the Chicago and New York City datasets include the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year
